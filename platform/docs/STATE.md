## On-chain `getVirtualFloorState()` return-value

```mermaid

    None --> RunningOrClosed_Running: createVirtualFloor()

    RunningOrClosed_* --> CancelledFlagged: cancelFlagged()

    RunningOrClosed_Running --> RunningOrClosed_Closed: t ‚â• tClose
    RunningOrClosed_Closed --> RunningOrClosed_ClosedUnresolvable: has commits to < 2 outcomes
    RunningOrClosed_Closed --> RunningOrClosed_ClosedPreResolvable: has commits to ‚â• 2 outcomes


    RunningOrClosed_ClosedUnresolvable --> CancelledUnresolvable: cancelUnresolvable()
    RunningOrClosed_ClosedPreResolvable --> RunningOrClosed_ClosedResolvable: t ‚â• tResolve



    RunningOrClosed_ClosedResolvable --> resolutionType: _resolve()
    resolutionType --> CancelledResolvedNoWinners: CancelledNoWinners
    resolutionType --> ResolvedWinners: Winners


    CancelledFlagged --> [*]
    CancelledUnresolvable --> [*]
    CancelledResolvedNoWinners --> [*]
    ResolvedWinners --> [*]
```

All `RunningOrClosed_*` states are represented with a single on-chain `internalState` of `RunningOrClosed`, but the `getVirtualFloorState()` function combines `internalState` with other inputs to determine the actual state.

## ChallengeableCreatorOracle

We now explode the `RunningOrClosed_ClosedResolvable` state into further sub-states, as stored on the `ChallengeableCreatorOracle` contract:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    %% Conditional states
    state RunningOrClosed_Closed <<choice>>
    state RunningOrClosed_ClosedResolvable_ResultComplete <<choice>>
    state resolutionType <<choice>>

    [*] --> None

    None --> RunningOrClosed_Running: createVirtualFloor()

    RunningOrClosed_* --> CancelledFlagged: cancelFlagged()

    RunningOrClosed_Running --> RunningOrClosed_Closed: t ‚â• tClose

    RunningOrClosed_Closed --> RunningOrClosed_ClosedUnresolvable: has commits to < 2 outcomes
    RunningOrClosed_Closed --> RunningOrClosed_ClosedPreResolvable: has commits to ‚â• 2 outcomes

    RunningOrClosed_ClosedUnresolvable --> CancelledUnresolvable: cancelUnresolvable()

    RunningOrClosed_ClosedPreResolvable --> RunningOrClosed_ClosedResolvable_ResultNone: t ‚â• tResolve

    %% RunningOrClosed_ClosedResolvable_* --> RunningOrClosed_ClosedResolvable_ResultComplete
    RunningOrClosed_ClosedResolvable_ResultNone --> RunningOrClosed_ClosedResolvable_ResultSet: setResult()\n@ t ‚â§ tResultSetMax
    RunningOrClosed_ClosedResolvable_ResultSet --> RunningOrClosed_ClosedResolvable_ResultChallenged: challengeSetResult()\n@ t ‚â§ tResultChallengeMax
    RunningOrClosed_ClosedResolvable_ResultChallenged --> RunningOrClosed_ClosedResolvable_ResultComplete: finalizeChallenge()
    RunningOrClosed_ClosedResolvable_ResultSet --> RunningOrClosed_ClosedResolvable_ResultComplete: confirmUnchallengedResult()\n@ t > tResultChallengeMax
    RunningOrClosed_ClosedResolvable_ResultNone --> RunningOrClosed_ClosedResolvable_ResultComplete: finalizeUnsetResult()\n@ t > tResultSetMax

    RunningOrClosed_ClosedResolvable_ResultComplete --> resolutionType: _resolve()
    resolutionType --> CancelledResolvedNoWinners: CancelledNoWinners
    resolutionType --> ResolvedWinners: Winners

    %% Stop-states
    CancelledFlagged --> [*]
    CancelledUnresolvable --> [*]
    CancelledResolvedNoWinners --> [*]
    ResolvedWinners --> [*]
```

The only details that are not visible in this diagram are that:
1. When the base contract‚Äôs ‚Äúcomputed‚Äù state (as reported by `getVirtualFloorState()`) goes into `CancelledResolvedNoWinners | ResolvedWinners`, in the extending `ChallengeableCreatorOracle` contract the corresponding `Resolution.state` for that VF will be moved (in parallel) to state `ResolutionState.Complete`.
2. If a VF set-result has been challenged, and therefore its `Resolution.state` in `ChallengeableCreatorOracle` is `ResolutionState.Challenged`, if at that moment the base contract‚Äôs state is forced by the platform-admin into `CancelledFlagged`, the `Resolution.state` will be moved (in parallel) into `ResolutionState.ChallengeCancelled`.
